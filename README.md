# Ezega Data Analysis

A few months ago a friend of mine, [Kidus](https://github.com/kidesleo), decided to scrape ezega.com, which is a sort of index for businesses in ethiopia. The result was a jsonl file with about 8k entries that I've been sitting on with the vague goal of looking into but not finding the time to.

Finally have time now, and while doing data analysis with clean datasets taken off the internet has been fun, it's not time to work with something dirty and real.

### Overview

The dataset contains the following columns:

- business_title: The title/name of the business.
- business_image: Image associated with the business.
- business_location: Location of the business.
- business_url: URL associated with the business.
- business_description: Description of the business.
- business_numbers: Numeric data related to the business.
- ezega_url: URL from Ezega website.
- category: Category of the business.
- sub_category: Sub-category of the business.


### Usage
To run the Jupyter Notebook:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install Jupyter Notebook if you haven't already (pip install jupyterlab).
- Navigate to the project directory and run jupyter notebook.
- Open the notebook file (Ethiopian_Business_Data_Analysis.ipynb) and execute the cells.
