# Ezega Data Analysis

A few months ago a friend of mine, [Kidus](https://github.com/kidesleo), decided to scrape ezega.com, which is a sort of index for businesses in ethiopia. The result was a jsonl file with about 8k entries that I've been sitting on with the vague goal of looking into but not finding the time to.

Finally have time now, and while doing data analysis with clean datasets taken off the internet has been fun, it's not time to work with something dirty and real.

Note: If you just want to look at it and not clone and play with it, then just check it out [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/senadev42/ezega-analysis/blob/main/Ezega%20Dataset%20Analysis%20-%20The%20Scenic%20Route.ipynb).
